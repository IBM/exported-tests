# Project Overview

A UI testing architecture for writing tests that is UI framework agnostic so the tests can be written once but used in any UI framework application. The tool contains the parser(s) that convert tests written in a unique format to testing framework specific structure/functions used by the application (e.g. Mocha, Jest, etc). This architecture was created by the Watson Health Design Pattern & Asset Library team.
